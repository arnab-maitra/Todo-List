# Todo List

**OBJECTIVE:**
To-do lists offer a way to increase productivity, stopping you from forgetting things, helps prioritise tasks, manage tasks effectively, use time wisely and improve time management as well as workflow.


**Tools and technologies used!**
1. JSP - 2.2 +
2. IDE â€“ Netbeans 8.2
3. XG Boost Classifier


**WHAT I HAD DONE:**

I have started with simple Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA), looked for some null or duplicate vales. 
Then splited the training and testing dataset using sklearn. 
Then I implemented different models to classify the message as spam or not-spam.

**MODELS USED:**
1. Naive Bayes (Multinominal)
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. XG Boost Classifier

**LIBRARIES NEEDED:**
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Sklearn

**CONCLUSION:**
| Models | Accuracy on Training Set  | Accuracy on Testing Set |
|:-----|:--------:|:------:|
| Naive Bayes (Multinominal) | 0.99346 | 0.96875 |
| Random Forest Classifier | 1.0 | 0.91666 |
| XG Boost Classifier | 0.97908 | 0.95833 |


| Naive Bayes (Multinominal) Training Set Accuracy  | Naive Bayes (Multinominal) Testing Set Accuracy |
